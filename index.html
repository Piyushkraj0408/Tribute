                <h1>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose</h1>
                <p>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose (1897-1945?) was a fearless freedom fighter and nationalist leader who
                    played a vital role in India's struggle for independence. Born in Cuttack, Odisha, he left the
                    Indian Civil Services to join the freedom movement, later becoming President of the Indian National
                    Congress in 1938. Differing from Gandhi's non-violence, Bose believed in armed resistance and formed
                    the Forward Bloc. During World War II, he organized the Indian National Army (INA) with the slogan
                    “Give me blood, and I will give you freedom!” and inspired millions with “Jai Hind.” Though he
                    reportedly died in a plane crash in 1945, his death remains mysterious. His courage, leadership, and
                    vision of a strong, independent India make him one of the most respected heroes of the nation.</p>

                    independence struggle. Known for his bravery and unwavering spirit, he was a key member of the

                <p>Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi (born Manikarnika Tambe in 1828) is remembered as one of the most iconic
                    heroines of India’s struggle against British rule. Married to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao of Jhansi, she
                    became queen at a young age and took charge of her state after his death. When the British tried to
                    annex Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse, she refused to give up her kingdom. In 1857, during the
                    First War of Independence, she led her troops with extraordinary courage, riding into battle dressed
                    as a warrior, sword in hand. She fought fearlessly against the British forces until she was martyred
                    in 1858 at the age of just 29. Her legendary bravery and determination made her a symbol of
                    resistance and inspired future generations to fight for freedom.</p>
